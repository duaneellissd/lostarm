/** @mainpage
 * @file
 * @brief This is an overview about the library called LostARM
 *
 * Lostarm originated as a standard library for ARM Based CPUs, it has evolved over time
 * and now is a series of drivers, and common debug features used in embedded development.
 *
 * History - I have written about 6 to 7 varients of this over my
 * profesional life, each place I goto - I recreate the package (because
 * the prevous place owned what I wrote there, and I wanted my own version)
