 * # Basic Counting semaphore.
 *
 * TL;DR -> this manages a counter, the semaphore blocks when it would go negative.
 *
 * Simple producer and consumer.
 *
 * Think of a producer inserting things into a circular buffer (adding to the counter)
 * And a consumer (an application thread, reading from the buffer, subtracting)
 *
 * The application stops/hangs when there is no more data in the buffer.
